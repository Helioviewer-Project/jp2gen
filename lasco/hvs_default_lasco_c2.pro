; Minimum required Helioviewer Setup (HVS) structure tags.
;
; Let us assume there is a device commonly known by its "nickname",
; but is actually a "detector" which is part of an "instrument" on a
; space or ground based "observatory".  There are "N" different
; measurements possible from the device.  The tags below are the
; minimum required.

;      hvs_details_filename: 'XXX',$
;      hvs_details_filename_version: 'Y.Z',$
;      details(N)}
;
; For each of the N measurements, there is a details structure.  The
; structure of the details structure is identical for every
; measurement, but the values can be different for each
; measurement. The tags below are the minimum required.
