;
; Details on how to transfer data from the production machine to the
; server
;
; As of 2010/03/24 the commands used are
;
; chown -R <local.group>:<remote.group> <filename>
; rsync -Ravxz --exclude "*.DS_Store" <filename> -e ssh -l
; <remote.user> @ <remote.machine> : <remote.incoming>
;
; Note that
;
; (1) local and remote computers MUST have the same group with the
; SAME group IDs and group names
; (2) the owner of the JP2 files MUST be member of that group on both
; the LOCAL machine and the REMOTE machine
;
; Linux gotcha: Ubuntu 9.10 (2010/03/24) requires that the JP2
; creation machine be RESTARTED before the group assignment for a user
; is recognized by the system.  For example, if you attempt to put
; a user into a group, then the change only "sticks" after a restart.
; This is important for the current application as you want the
; username on both the local and remote machines to be in the same groups.
;
; 2010/04/06
;
; Use with Mac OS X
;
; The functionality as implemented requires use of version 3.0.7 of
; rsync as downloaded from http://rsync.samba.org/ .  This utility was
; compiled on the local Mac OS X machine and installed into
; /usr/local/bin .  This was done since the version of rsync supplied
; on the local machine was at version 2.0.0 and so was long out of
; date.
;
; We recommend using the same procedure:  download, compile and
; install rsync from the above link and use the script below to
; transfer the JP2 files from a local OS X machine (where the FITS to
; JP2 process is running) to where your instance of the JP2 database
; is stored.
;
;
; Summary
; -------
; Program to transfer files from the outgoing directory to a remote
; location.  The program first forms a list of the subdirectories and
; files, moves those files to the remote location, and then deletes
; those files from the outgoing directory.
